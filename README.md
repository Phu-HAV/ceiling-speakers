GitHub uploads

Make sure you do a pull request before pushing your work to GitHub when working collaboratively. 

run 'git checkout (branch name)' - git checkout -b <branch> origin/<branch> creates a new branch based on origin/<branch>, and does not contact the remote repository. It looks at origin/<branch> as it currently exists in your local repository.

run 'git pull' - git pull contacts the remote repository identified by origin and looks for updates. It fetches any updates and then merges the changes into the target branch. It does not create a new branch.

run 'git add . ' git add will add files you specify into local repository ready to be pushed to Git. In this case we will use period to add all the files.

run 'git commit -m "new commit" ' - this will add a message to your commited files

Finally run 'git push' - this will push the files to Git.
